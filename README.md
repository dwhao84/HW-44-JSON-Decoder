# HW#44 JSON Decoder

This is a basic practice for a CRUD App. I'm using the Youbike API to create an App.

Here is the link for the JSON URL:
> [Youbike JSON URL](https://tcgbusfs.blob.core.windows.net/dotapp/youbike/v2/youbike_immediate.json)

Let users easily navigate from their current location to the closest Youbike station.

## Features:

### - Display YouBike Stations on Map:
Through the map interface, users can clearly see the locations of various YouBike stations, each represented by an annotation. Annotations include the station's latitude and longitude, name, and other related information.
